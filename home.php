<h2><img src="/images/avatar.png" height="305" width="184" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" title="The Avatar Bren"/><br/>Hello and welcome to my page!</h2>
<p>Athough this site is currently under construction,I will hopefully be able to update it regularily enough and make it interesting and useful.</p>
<p>This site, is written entirely in my self produced CMS (content management system). The site progress may seem slow to start, but that is because I am busy toiling away, makeing the back-end impressive. What does that mean to you...? Not likely a whole lot, as you will just see the rendered HTML on your screen, not the magic behind it. I am making this CMS for myself for a few reasons, first and foremost, like most developers, I enjoy coding and simply creating something interesting and useful. I also learn alot from others and want to be able to contribute to the community, and put forward some of my own ideas and creations which may help/be used by others. Perhaps when I think my CMS is good enough, I'll publicize the source, or use parts of it as snippets to help someone out. It's also much more rewarding to build something yourself and then you also have the perk of controlling the source!</p>
<p>So, what's this site going to be about..?</p>
<p>Well to be direct, anything and everything that interests me. I am going to try to update this page regularily with code snippets of javascript, jquery, css, html, php, ios etc etc. This way myself and others can look at some of my example work and use it to aid in faster creation of things. I mean, copy and paste was invented for a reason right? I am a firm believer in not re-inventing the wheel, unless of course it can be improved upon.</p>
<p>I also have a <a target="_blank" href="http://bren1818.blogspot.com/">blog</a> which I was using as a code repository and rant forum, but this has taken over my free time.</p>
<p>I hope you find something of interest here, and if you'd like to chat, feel free to fire me off an email to: <a target="_blank" href="mailto:brendon.irwin@gmail.com">brendon.irwin@gmail.com</a>.
